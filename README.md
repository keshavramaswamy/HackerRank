1.Laptop Battery Life 

--*Linear Regression Model implemented using _SciPy_ with _Pandas_ package.

Training data (each row)consists of the amount of time the laptop was charged and amount of time the battery lasted.

Amount of time the battery lasts was predicted for each test input using the model.
